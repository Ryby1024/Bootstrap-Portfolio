                    <p class="lead">Hello, my name is Roy Davis and I am an inspiring Web Developer/Software Engineer. I have worked in retail for over 20 years and have decided I want a new, rewarding career path. I have already obtained my A.S in Computer IT and I am now currently enrolled in the UCF coding bootcamp.</p>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>During my time working in retail, I have done many jobs. I have worked for Publix Supermarkets since 1996. I started as a bagger while in highschool and eventually moved all the way up to a Department Manager position. I eventually realized that retail management was not in the best interest of my family or I so I decided it was time for a change.</p>

                    <p>Shortly after the birth of my third child, my wife and I decided it would be best if I pursued a college degree. It took almost 6 years, but I was finally able to earn my Associates in Computer IT in December of 2016. It was very rewarding to know that I stuck with it and was able to accomplish something I could be proud of.</p>
